For Python, it uses regex for basic extraction; for Rust, a more sophisticated check is implemented.\n3. **Transformation**: Once unused items are detected, the transformer generates suggestions to remove them from the source code. This involves simple pattern-based removals in this version.\n4. **Validation**: After transformation, it validates the changes by checking if the modified files remain syntactically valid.\n\nSpecific functions include:\n- `detect_unused_code`: Analyzes code for unused elements.\n- `remove_unused_code`: Applies the detected removal suggestions to the source files.\n- `validate_transformed_files`: Ensures that the transformed files are still syntactically correct."

    "This file implements a multi-language code transformation engine using Comby-style pattern matching and replacement, enabling consistent transformations across different programming languages like Rust, Java, and Python. It includes features for language detection, configuration management, and syntax validation after transformations. Users can apply default transformations or specific patterns to their codebases, with options to use an internal implementation or an external Comby tool for processing. The engine also supports custom pattern creation and preserves formatting and comments during transformations. For example, it can detect unused arguments in Rust code and replace magic numbers with named constants across multiple languages.\n\n```rust\n// Example of applying a transformation using the multi-language transformer\n\nuse codehud_transform::transformers::multi_language_old::{MultiLanguageTransformer, MultiLanguageConfig};\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create a configuration for transformations\n    let config = MultiLanguageConfig {\n        use_external_comby: false,\n        max_file_size: 1024 * 1024, // 1 MB\n        validate_syntax: true,\n        preserve_formatting: true,\n        preserve_comments: true,\n        line_ending_style: IndentStyle::Spaces(4),\n        max_line_length: 80,\n    };\n\n    // Create a new multi-language transformer with the configuration\n    let transformer = MultiLanguageTransformer::new(config);\n\n    // Source code to transform\n    let source_code = r#\"fn example(x: i32) {\n        if x > 10 {\n            println!(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\"#;\n\n    // Apply a transformation using a default pattern (e.g., removing unused arguments)\n    let result = transformer.apply_default_transformations(source_code.to_string(), \"Rust\");\n\n    match result {\n        Ok(transformed) => {\n            println!(\"Transformed Code:\\n{}\", transformed.source_code);\n            println!(\"Warnings: {:?}\", transformed.warnings);\n        }\n        Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error: {}\", e),\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MultiLanguageTransformer` is configured to remove unused arguments from a Rust function. The source code is processed through the transformation engine, which detects and removes the unused argument `x`, while preserving the formatting and comments of the original code. This demonstrates the multi-language transformer's ability to perform cross-language refactorings with consistent patterns across different programming languages."
