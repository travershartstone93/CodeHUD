CodeHUD Vision: The Foundation for Autonomous Code Intelligence
==============================================================

THE TRUE PURPOSE OF CODEHUD
===========================

CodeHUD is not a developer tool competing with IDEs or editors. It is a sophisticated research platform designed to solve the fundamental problem of autonomous code maintenance: **How do you give LLMs the structured, contextual understanding they need to safely and effectively modify large codebases?**

CodeHUD exists as the "eyes" of an autonomous coding system - the analysis and data collection engine that feeds structured, prioritized, architecturally-aware information to LLM-driven refactoring and debugging systems. It is the missing foundation that makes truly intelligent autonomous code work possible.

THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
=======================

Most LLM coding tools fail because they operate on isolated files without architectural context. They lack:
- Understanding of system-wide impact of changes
- Prioritization of what actually needs fixing
- Structured representation of codebase health and relationships  
- Safe operation patterns for autonomous modifications
- Context bridging between human intentions and machine actions

CodeHUD was built to answer: **What analysis data and operational patterns do LLMs actually need to perform autonomous code maintenance that humans would trust?**

THE DUAL ARCHITECTURE VISION
============================

CodeHUD operates as two interconnected systems:

   - Performance data guides optimization decisions
   - Security analysis prevents vulnerability introduction

3. **SAFE OPERATION PATTERNS**
   - Staging systems for preview before application
   - Granular approval workflows for different risk levels
