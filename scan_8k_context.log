📄 Summary preview: ## Overall Architecture

The system is designed with a three-layer architecture: Extraction, Analysis, and Presentation layers, each serving distinct purposes to ensure efficient code analysis and presentation of results.

### Extraction Layer
This layer is responsible for monitoring filesystem changes to trigger initial extractions based on detected modifications. It includes two primary components:
- **CodeHUD-Realtime**: Uses the `notify` library to watch specified directories and process fil...
